October 2019. On a clear winter's night, my co-founder and I met for the first time in a congenial bar alongside the Danube in the heart of Vienna, Austria, witnessing the glory of the starlit sky above our heads. Skipping any form of unnecessary small talk, we immediately sunk into an hour-long discourse about our shared vision that one day, each and every hungry child will be blessed with a full plate of fresh, nutritious and sustainable food whenever they are hungry. That is why three years later, we decided to go on the mission of building ‚Ä¶

_Nope. Not true.._

Even if it's not backed by such a romantic backstory, we are 2 techies aiming toward building their own business.

<u>We have already tried once</u>  
Back in 2019, we actually had the brilliant idea to build contract management software to eradicate the endless horror of keeping an eye on the infinite amount of contracts all of us (apparently don‚Äôt) have. Of course, everyone knows the first thing to do while building the next billion-dollar enterprise is to buy a domain. So we purchased¬†*"contrax.at",*¬†designed 2 quite dissimilar wireframes and asked strangers on the street which one they liked more. While being ignored around 50% of the time, we got some responses. "I like that one more because the font is easier to read", "I do not like that star; it looks too playful". "I do two-sided bookkeeping for my household" ~ 24year old Business Informatics Student.

The answer to "would you pay for that?" was a unanimous "No".

My co-founder and I agreed that humanity was hopelessly lost, so we gave up on that idea.

<u>Let‚Äôs try it again</u>

After some frustration in other occupations, we both realised that the concept of being an employee did not really work for us (nor our employers), and we decided to initiate a second attempt at building our own company.

‚Äú_How do you find an idea? How do you validate whether your idea is actually relevant? How do you recruit people for initial user interviews where everything you have to offer is a list of questions and a warm smile? What colour should your login button have? Whitespace or Tabs? How do you go from nothing to MVP, and what comes after it? How many commas does a privacy statement have? How long can penguins stay underwater?"_

Thank you so much for making it all this way. If you haven‚Äôt learned anything from this article so far: According to the following report by the University of Bristol, Emperor Penguins can stay underwater for up to 27 minutes - the longest among their peers. üêß
